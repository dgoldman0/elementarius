# Combining Stones

Mana stones can be combined to increase their effectiveness. Number of common stones to make each rarity:

- Common - 1
- Uncommon - 7
- Rare - 49
- Epic - 343
- Legendary - 2401

The same type of stone must be used. So for instance, fire stones of insight cannot be combined with fire stones of creation. Combining stones is different from crafting items and does not require a mana stone as a focus. It does however require mana of the same type equal to the number of stones being used.

Since a person may want to fuse stones together even though they don't have enough mana, each stone will have a unique identifier and how many common stones are fused to create it.

# Crafting Items

A stone of creation is needed to craft items, as a focus for the mana. A common stone can only common items. A uncommon stone can only uncommon items, and so on. You can use higher tier stones to craft lower tier items. Doing so increases the chance of success and decreases the chances of the stone shattering.

## Shattering

A stone has a 10% chance of shattering when crafting an item of equal rarity. But if the stone is used to craft something of lower rarity, that risk is cut in half for each level of rarity. An epic stone can therefore craft an uncommon item with only a 2.5% chance of shattering.

### Upcrafting

A user may attempt to craft something of higher rarity than a mana stone allows. Doing so creates a great risk of failure. Only 5% of the time will it succeed, and if it fails, all the mana and the stone are lost.

## Mana Stones

A common mana stone requires 100 mana of the desired stone type. A stone of creation is also needed. In addition to the base mana needed for insight, making a stone of creation will require 25 Light and 25 Darkness mana, and making a stone of life will require 50 Spirit mana.

## Light, Darkness, and Spirit Mana

These types of mana do not come from puzzles and must be created by combining mana of different types. To craft Light, take 50 Air mana and 50 Fire mana, and use a creation stone of Light. To craft Darkness, take 50 Water mana and 50 Earth mana and use a creation stone of Darkness. Finally, to craft Spirit, take 50 Light mana and 50 Darkness mana and use a creation stone of Spirit.

# Starter Pack

This game should be free to play. Each player will have one invite slot that can be used to invite new players. Once the new player joins, they'll get a starter pack with 100 of each mana, a common insight stone of each mana type, and a common creation stone of each mana type.

# Packs

Stones and mana can be acquired by opening packs. A pack will cost $2, with quantity discounts and discounts for using ARC available.

This system will make it easier for people to get into the game if they aren't interested in free to play. Each pack has five slots which could be filled with either mana or if a player is lucky, a magic stone.

## Mana Generation

If a slot contains mana, it will contain no less than 50 and no more than 1,000 mana. The distribution will be log normal with these cutoffs in mind. The probability of getting one of the basic mana types is 5/27, the probability of getting one of the secondary types is 3/27, and the probability of getting Spirit mana is 1/27.

## Mana Stones

There is a 10% chance that instead of mana, users will receive a mana stone. The same probabilities for which type of mana a person gets is the same as with regular mana generation. The probability of a common stone will be roughly 85.7%, and each higher rarity will have 1/7th the probability of the previous rarity. Finally, there will be a 75% chance of getting a stone of insight, a 20% chance of getting a stone of creation, and only a 5% chance of getting a stone of life.

# Creatures

Not much is considered with creatures and how they'll battle. There will be rarities of creature which can only be forged by the appropriate life stone. Creatures will have mana based stats, resistances, weaknesses, etc.

## Breeding

Not every angel wants to create life from scratch. Some are happy to selectively breed existing creatures. The offspring of two creatures will have stats related to both parents. Direct relatives cannot breed. Additionally, breeding does take some mana.

# Training & Specialization

As users decide how to play the game, their decisions will impact their skill sets. Over time, users who become specialized in a given skill set, such as puzzle solving or breeding, will gain stats bonuses to show their hard work.
